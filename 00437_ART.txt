Abstract

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of chloroquine

derivatives in patients, based on unpublished and published reports available publicly on the internet as of 27 May 2020. The keywords
‘hydroxychloroquine’, ‘chloroquine’, ‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-Cov-2’ were used in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Google
search engines without any restrictions as to date or language. Twenty studies were identiﬁed involving 105 040 patients (19 270 treated
patients) from nine countries (Brazil, China, France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and the USA). Big data observational studies
were associated with conﬂict of interest,
were associated with favourable outcomes and details on therapy. Among clinical studies, three of four randomized controlled trials
reported a signiﬁcant favourable effect. Among clinical studies, a signiﬁcant favourable summary effect was observed for duration of
−6) and
cough (OR 0.19, p 0.00003), duration of fever (OR 0.11, p 0.039), clinical cure (OR 0.21, p 0.0495), death (OR 0.32, p 4.1 × 10
viral shedding (OR 0.43, p 0.031). A trend for a favourable effect was noted for the outcome ‘death and/or intensive care unit transfer’
(OR 0.29, p 0.069) with a point estimate remarkably similar to that observed for death (~0.3). In conclusion, a meta-analysis of publicly

lack of treatment dosage and duration, and absence of favourable outcome. Clinical studies

available clinical reports demonstrates that chloroquine derivatives are effective to improve clinical and virological outcomes, but, more
importantly, they reduce mortality by a factor of 3 in patients with COVID-19. Big data are lacking basic treatment deﬁnitions and are
linked to conﬂict of interest. The retraction of the only big data study associated with a signiﬁcantly deleterious effect the day after (June
5, 2020) the acceptance of the present work (June 4, 2020) conﬁrms the relevance of this work.

Introduction

In periods of large epidemics such as the current coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, information spreads very

fast with different levels of reliability, including fake news, press
In
releases, preprints and peer-reviewed published reports.
addition, it seems that there is a competition between low-cost
generic medications that are potentially effective against severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
very expensive new drugs that are not yet approved, implying
ﬁnancial and organizational
issues, stakeholders expectations
and administrative/policy complexity. This may lead to positions
that are not driven only by science and public health.

In this context, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis on the
effects of chloroquine derivatives (i.e. hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) or chloroquine) in individuals with COVID-19, based

on all available information from preprints and peer-reviewed
published reports. For preprints, we asked two reviewers of
our team to provide an open review of the content (see Sup-
plementary material, Appendix S1) and we considered the
comment of an external scientist [1]. We were surprised to
ﬁnd major discrepancies between study conclusions ranging
from dramatic clinical
improvement to dramatic increase in
mortality rates under chloroquine-derivative treatment. We
sought to understand what could explain such differences. We
recently discussed the fact that it does not make sense to
investigate a summary effect when inconsistent studies and
unexplained heterogeneity make the average effect difﬁcult to
interpret and potentially misleading [2]. Hence, we ﬁrst inves-
tigated the differential characteristics of studies showing a very
favourable effect of the treatment and of studies showing a
clearly deleterious effect.

First, we found that a clear standardized protocol
for
treatment [3] and follow up was detailed in studies conducted
by clinicians (clinical studies), whereas it was completely lacking
in studies conducted by public-health experts on a large num-
ber of patients whose data were extracted from electronic
medical records (big data). We have already pointed out the
limitations of these ‘big data’ analyses in relation to clinical in-
accuracy [4].

(early

Adequate timing

administration versus delayed
administration), dosage, screening of contraindications, adjuvant
measures and monitoring following standardized protocols are
critical in the beneﬁt–risk ratio of any drug against infectious
diseases [3]. Based on our 30 years of experience treating
hundreds of patients with Q fever endocarditis and Whipple’s
disease with HCQ 600 mg/day (200 mg three times per day)
[5,6], we know that this drug is effective with negligible side
effects when compared to the fatal outcome of both diseases.
Chloroquine derivatives (and paracetamol) can be used to
commit suicide with overdose [7] and may be fatal, at thera-
peutic dosage, when contraindications and adjuvant measures
are not carefully followed. In this context, it is expected that
studies using double-dose HCQ (1200 mg/day) in COVID-19
would be associated with toxicity [8]. Accordingly, we investi-
gated whether a well-described treatment protocol, including
dosage, for at least 48 hours was associated with an improved
outcome.

From our seminal study [9], we observed an improved efﬁ-
cacy of the combination of HCQ and azithromycin when
compared with HCQ alone. A synergistic effect was conﬁrmed
by in vitro studies [10]. This led us to change our standardized
protocol by shifting from a mono-therapy to a combined
therapy. This combination could not be neglected in the
treatment of COVID-19 and was therefore also analysed in the
present study.

In the context of a pandemic with an unknown virus,
development of new drugs is a major opportunity for ‘big
pharma’ industry, and this is potentially associated with a very
high risk of conﬂicts of interest. This led us to consider these
conﬂicts of interest as a moderator variable in the present
work. As major ﬁnancial issues are at stake, and may impact the
interpretation of scientiﬁc data, we felt it was important to
mention that none of us have conﬂict of
interest with any
pharmaceutical company.

We performed this meta-analysis taking into account three
important moderator variables: clinical studies or studies based
on electronic registry data analysis (big data), studies based on a
mono-therapy (chloroquine derivatives) or a combined therapy
(HCQ with azithromycin), and ﬁnally studies where authors
had potential conﬂicts of interest and where authors had no
conﬂicts of interest. In the context of the current pandemic,
providing a timely and critical analysis of available data on this
topic seems appropriate to us, from a public-health perspective.

Methods

We conducted a meta-analysis of studies evaluating the effects
of chloroquine derivatives against SARS-CoV-2 in groups of
patients with COVID-19 as compared with control groups of
patients who did not receive chloroquine derivatives. In these
studies, groups were expected to be similar with respect to
demographics, chronic conditions, clinical presentation at
enrolment and use of other antiviral drugs during the course of
the disease. The keywords ‘hydroxychloroquine’, ‘chloroquine’,
‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’ and ‘SARS-Cov-2’ were used in the
PubMed, Google Scholar and Google search engines without
any restrictions as to date or language. Preprints were also
included. Open reviews and reviewer’s recommendations
regarding preprints are available in the Supplementary material
(Appendix S1). Articles published in peer-reviewed journals,
preprints and articles available on the internet, even when not
published on ofﬁcial websites, were included.

The following outcomes were considered: hospitalization
rate, duration of cough, duration of
fever, clinical cure,
lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein level, interleukin-6 level,
thoracic CT scan, worsening to severe symptoms, death,
length of
transfer to intensive care unit (ICU), ventilation,
hospital stay and persistent viral shedding as assessed by PCR.
Only studies in which a group of COVID19 patients treated
with a chloroquine derivative were compared with a control
group without chloroquine derivatives were included. Non-
comparative (single-arm) studies and studies comparing two
groups treated with chloroquine derivatives at different dosages
or with different delays of treatment were excluded.

Studies were classiﬁed as ‘big data’ studies when conducted
on electronic medical records extracted by public-health spe-
cialists and epidemiologists who did not care for COVID-19
patients themselves. Conversely, studies were classiﬁed as
‘clinical studies’ when they mentioned details of treatments (e.g.
dosages, duration, contraindications, monitoring) and where
the authors were physicians (infectious diseases and internal
medicine specialists, and pulmonologists) who cared for
COVID-19 patients themselves. Conﬂicts of
interest were
retrieved from author statements in the article. Another check
was performed using the Euros for Docs (https://www.
(https://projects.
eurosfordocs.fr/)
propublica.org/docdollars/) websites. We considered that
there was a conﬂict of interest when funding by the pharma-
ceutical industry exceeded V50 000 over 7 years.

Studies were classiﬁed as ‘Pro’, when at least one compari-
son reported a signiﬁcant improvement, and none was associ-
ated with a signiﬁcant deleterious effect in the treated group.
Studies were classiﬁed as ‘Con’ when none of the comparisons
reported a signiﬁcant favourable outcome and/or at least one
comparison reported a signiﬁcant deleterious outcome.

The meta-analysis was performed with a randomized model
using COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS v3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ,
USA) as recommended by Borenstein et al. [11]. This software
made it possible to include dichotomous outcomes (number of
events out of the total) and quantitative outcomes (mean in
each group, sample size, p-value). Heterogeneity was consid-
ered substantial when I2 >50%. A p-value <0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant. A heat map analysis was performed to test a possible
clustering between Pro and Con studies, clinical and big data
study design, well-described treatment protocol and not
described treatment protocol, and conﬂict of interest and no
conﬂict of interest, using XLSTAT v2020.2.2 (Addinsoft, Paris,
France).

Results

Twenty-three comparative studies were screened. Three
studies were excluded because they compared two groups
treated with a chloroquine derivative (high versus low dose [8]
and combination therapy with or without zinc [13]). As a result,
20 studies were identiﬁed involving 105 040 individuals (19 270
patients treated with a chloroquine derivative, including 11 247
in combination with a macrolide) from nine countries (Brazil,
China, France, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and the
USA) (see Supplementary material, Table S1). The 20 studies
included eight published papers, nine preprints published on
MedRxiv, one preprint published on preprints.org and two
(uniform resource locator (url)
available on the internet

provided in the Supplementary material, Table S2). All but two
papers, in Chinese [14] and French [15], were written in En-
glish. The Chinese study [14] was translated and included.

We noted that registry studies based on electronic medical
records did not mention the dosage or included several dosages
of the chloroquine derivatives used [16–20]. We found that in
several studies, patients used several molecules with established
or potential antiviral properties. For instance, in China and Iran
almost all patients used multiple antivirals: lopinavir/ritonavir,
oseltamivir, entecavir, ribavirin, umifenovir and nebulization of
interferon aerosol. In eight studies [15,18–24] patients were
given the combined therapy that we have recommended (HCQ

We observed major methodological pitfalls in some studies.
Lymphopenia, a marker of severity [28], was signiﬁcantly more
frequent in the treated group in one study [17]. In another
study, eight patients received HCQ in the ‘untreated’ group
[29]. In this study, none of the 15 patients treated with com-
bined therapy (HCQ + azithromycin) died or were transferred
to the ICU, and the difference was signiﬁcant with the un-
treated control group. Strikingly, this was not analysed because
it was not prespeciﬁed in the study protocol. In another work
[27], all results reporting a favourable effect of HCQ in the ﬁrst
version of the preprint [30] on alleviation of symptoms and C-
reactive protein were removed in the ﬁnal preprint version
[27] and in the published version of the article [31]. Finally, the
largest study that has been carried out [18] is impossible to
analyse because there is no notiﬁcation of hospital sources or
referral to any physician. It is not known if the authors of this
study saw a single patient infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Big data and clinical studies were perfectly
discriminated by unsupervised clustering
As we observed that several studies reported a clear favourable
effect [15,21–23,25,26,30,32–35] but others reported no ef-
fect [14,16,17,19,24,29] or a clear deleterious effect [18], we
analysis
primarily performed an unsupervised clustering
including the following variables: ‘Pro’/‘Con’ studies, ‘big data’
versus ‘clinical studies’, ‘detailed’ or ‘absence of detailed treat-
ment’, presence or absence of a conﬂict of interest (Fig. 1).

In this unsupervised analysis, only the variable ‘big data’
versus ‘clinical’ studies yielded to a perfect clustering. All other
variables (conﬂict of interest, Pro/Con, detailed treatment) did
not provide a perfect clustering. We subsequently investigate
whether each of these parameters was signiﬁcantly associated
with favourable or unfavourable effect.

All ‘big data’ studies reported a lack of beneﬁcial effect of the
treatment and were signiﬁcantly more likely to be associated

observed by examination of the meta-analysis forest plot (Fig. 2,
see Supplementary material, Tables S3 to S8). In addition, both
‘conﬂicts of
interest’ (p 0.01) and ‘not described treatment
protocol’ variables (p 0.004) were associated with the ‘Con’
variable. Conversely, clinical studies were more likely to report a
favourable effect of chloroquine derivatives in individuals with
COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Consistently, clinical studies with detailed
treatment protocol were more likely to be associated with the
observation of a favourable effect of the treatment (p < 0.05).

favour of Con
We found four studies with author conﬂicts of interest (Fig. 1;
see Supplementary material, Table S1). The ‘Conﬂicts of in-
terest’ variable was associated with big data studies (3/5 versus
1/15, p < 0.05) and had a negative direction of treatment effect
(p < 0.05, Fig. 1).

Direct care of patients (clinical versus big data) explains
the direction of effect
We primarily tested if the studies involving direct care of pa-
tients (clinical studies performed by physicians who took care
of patients) were associated with a different direction of effect
compared with ‘big data’ studies (Fig. 2). The visual examination
of the forest plot clearly showed that ‘big data’ studies reported
no effect [16,17,19,20] or deleterious effect [18]. In contrast,
several clinical studies reported signiﬁcant favourable effects,
notably regarding hospitalization rate [21], duration of fever
[25,33], duration of cough [23,25], clinical cure [15,30], C-
reactive protein levels [30], interleukin-6 levels [35], thoracic
CT-imaging [25], length of hospital stay [23,26], death or ICU
transfer [22,32], death [34,35] and persistent viral shedding
[9,23,33].

ported a signiﬁcant effect, and all were beneﬁcial. The difference
was highly signiﬁcant (4/4 versus 0/17, Bilateral Mid-P exact test,
p 0.00016). This was also supported by the signiﬁcant hetero-
geneity between the two subgroups (big data versus clinical

Three of four RCTs reported a signiﬁcant favourable

Four RCTs were included [14,25–27,30,31]. All were per-
formed in China. Three of them reported signiﬁcant favourable
effects. Chen Z et al. [25] reported a signiﬁcant favourable ef-
fect on duration of fever, duration of cough and thoracic CT
imaging. Huang et al. reported a signiﬁcant reduction of length
of hospital stay (26). Interestingly, Tang et al. [27] reported in
the ﬁrst version of their preprint [30] a signiﬁcant favourable
effect on alleviation of symptoms (post hoc analysis) and C-
reactive protein reduction (subgroup with baseline increased
C-reactive protein), but these results were removed in the ﬁnal
[27,31]. This was

associated with a risk of not ﬁnding a difference when there is
one, but not with a risk of ﬁnding a difference when there is
none. None of these RCTs reported a signiﬁcant deleterious
effect.

Effect of chloroquine derivatives without azithromycin
As several studies addressed the effectiveness of the combi-
nation of chloroquine derivatives with a macrolide, speciﬁcally
azithromycin, we tested whether the favourable clinical effect
(observed in clinical studies) remained after exclusion of com-
parisons with combination therapy (see Supplementary mate-
rial, Fig. S1). A favourable effect was still observed for duration
of cough (n = 1, point estimate 0.12, p 0.001), duration of fever

0.20–1.33, p 0.17).

Outcomes with a signiﬁcant summary effect in clinical
studies
We found a favourable summary effect on duration of cough (n = 2,
point estimate 0.19, 95% CI 0.09–0.42, p 0.00003; I2 = 0%),
duration of fever (n = 3, point estimate 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.90, p
0.039; I2 = 91%, p < 0.001), clinical cure (n = 3, point estimate 0.21,
95% CI 0.05–1.0, p 0.0495; I2 = 81%, p < 0.001) and death (n = 4,
−6; I2 = 0%, p 0.71;
point estimate 0.32, 95% CI 0.19–0.52, p 4.1 × 10
see Supplementary material, Table S9). A trend for the outcome
‘death or ICU transfer’ was also noted (n = 3, point estimate 0.29,
95% CI 0.08–1.10, p 0.069; I2 = 85%, p < 0.002) with a point es-
timate very similar to that observed for the death outcome (0.3,
e.g. a three-fold decrease in the risk of ICU transfer and/or death).
For persistent viral shedding, ten comparisons were included with
a signiﬁcant favourable effect on persistent viral shedding (n = 10,
point estimate 0.43, 95% CI 0.20–0.92, p 0.031;
I2 = 75%,
p < 0.001).

Discussion

Chloroquine derivatives present a paradox. On the one hand,
the heterogeneity of patients and treatment schemes makes it
difﬁcult to obtain a clear picture while the epidemic is still
ongoing. On the other hand, despite controversy, only chlo-
roquine derivatives have been used by physicians on a large-
scale basis as a treatment for COVID-19 [36]. According to
the Sermo Real Time Covid-19 Barometer (https://www.
sermo.com/, consulted 27 May), for over 20 000 physicians
across 30 countries, chloroquine derivatives are the ﬁrst
medication used to treat COVID-19 patients in ICUs (43%;
except oxygen,
and
norepinephrine) and in other hospital settings (52%; except
oxygen), and the second in outpatient settings (33%, after AZ
and similar antibiotics).

anti-clotting/anticoagulants,

steroids

clinical studies used a standardized treatment protocol with
methods that included assessment of contraindications, daily
dosage, adjuvant measures and duration of treatment with at
least 48 hours of treatment before the objective could be
assessed. For example, assessment of kalaemia and electrocar-
diogram is critical before treatment, especially when the chlo-
roquine derivative is combined with azithromycin [37]. At the
same time, we observed that virtual big data studies did not
mention these elements and considered the presence of chlo-
roquine derivative prescription in electronic records in a binary
fashion. Obviously, the number of patients included in the
database analyses was much higher than the number of patients
included in the clinical studies, because these databases are
made up of
thousands of electronic medical records. As
mentioned in the past [4], this type of study has tremendous
statistical power but is limited by clinical inaccuracy that makes
their conclusions difﬁcult to believe.

We cannot believe that in some series up to 8% of deaths are
due to cardiac rhythm disorders [18], whereas all the elec-
trocardiograms performed in the IHU (our centre) for 4000
patients and analysed by a team of cardiologists specializing in
heart rhythms have not seen any, except for an increase in
QTc, which justiﬁed stopping treatment in only three in-
dividuals [38]. Under these conditions we thought that people
who really observed the patients had a very different percep-
tion of the results from people who had not observed the
patients but retained observations. The major elements of this
study are that, overall, there is an extremely signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the analyses of data not collected directly by the
doctors who cared for the patients and the studies carried out
by the physicians who set up these studies and cared for pa-
tients, including the randomized studies. The second thing is
that in the studies conducted electronically, the treatment is
never really speciﬁed, with the dosage and duration of treat-
ment making it impossible to assess efﬁcacy (dose too low) or
toxicity (dose too high). In addition to this major bias, we also
noted a signiﬁcant bias when the authors had conﬂicts of in-
terest due to their relationship with industrialists trying to
framework
market molecules
competing with HCQ.

in the same therapeutic

For discrepancies in published data, favourable evidence for
chloroquine derivatives is sometimes censored by the journal
(open review of Tang’s randomized controlled trial, published
in the British Medical
Journal [27,30,31]). For the article by
Mahevas et al. [29], one of us (DR) had contact with one of the
authors (B Godeau), who told him that it was the methodol-
ogist (P Ravaud) who did not want to carry out the statistical
tests demonstrating the superiority of dual therapy over the
control group (death or transfer to ICU, 0/15 versus 16/63,
bilateral Mid-P exact test p = 0.02).

Indeed, we were challenged by the major discrepancies be-
tween the results of the various published studies and our

Million et al. Efﬁcacy of chloroquine derivatives for COVID-19 in the real world

7

Overall, and as previously published, the relevance of the
analysis of important medical data depends on clinical accuracy
[4]. Indeed, the discrepancy between clinicians and epidemiol-
ogists reﬂects a major trend, that of the analysis of large medical
data, with a database warehouse more or less well ﬁlled by
individuals who are not directly included in the work reported.
This analysis is unrelated to the observations made by physi-
cians who are in direct contact with patients, and which lead to
divergent interpretations and opposite conclusions, which are
of real
interest and show that the world predicted by Bau-
drillard [39]—a parallel world of numerical analysis completely
disconnected from reality—is being born.

Under these conditions, a meta-analysis allowing for the
combination of different studies makes it possible to identify a
general trend. This makes it possible to reconcile the chlo-
roquine derivative efﬁcacy that many doctors have perceived
with the results of the ﬁrst published studies. This meta-
analysis is based on several studies, including four RCTs, and
identiﬁes a favourable trend toward the beneﬁt of chloroquine
derivatives in the treatment of individuals with COVID-19,
enabling us to make a grade I recommendation for its use
against the disease. The retraction of the only big data study
associated with a signiﬁcantly deleterious effect the day after
(June 5, 2020) the acceptance of the present work (June 4,
2020) conﬁrms the relevance of this work.
